 **About Me**

As a data enthusiast with a solid grasp of Python, SQL, Power BI, and AWS, I specialize in turning messy, complex datasets into clear, strategic insights. I enjoy bridging the gap between data and decision-makingâ€”whether thatâ€™s through building automated analytics pipelines, crafting AI-driven solutions, or designing dashboards that speak for themselves.

**Current Focus**

**Sentiment Analysis with NLP**

Exploring how natural language processing can uncover emotions and opinions in text. I'm building models to analyze public sentiment on current affairs, social trends, and user feedback.

**Data-Driven Storytelling**

Writing blogs that combine data, narrative, and visualization to make complex topics accessible. Topics range from media coverage patterns to behavioral insights.

**Portfolio in Progress**

Currently developing a collection of projects that merge NLP, data visualization, and real-world contextâ€”designed to showcase practical, insightful data applications.
